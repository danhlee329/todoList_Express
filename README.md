# Introduction
This todo list api service provides basic operations on managing a todo list.  The data is stored locally per API instance.  The operations were referenced from [this swagger example](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/aweiker/ToDo/1.0.0#/).
# Getting Started
This is a NodeJS application, which will require the latest Long Term Suuport (LTS) version of Node install on your machine (latest development efforts relied on v8.11.3). Once installed, clone this project into a local directory.  Once in the local directory, run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

# Build and Test
To run the app, run `npm start` in the console in the same directory (currently running on http://localhost:8080).

To run the test, run `npm test` in the console in the same directory.

# Postman Files
Postman files are provided for local development (both collection and environment).
